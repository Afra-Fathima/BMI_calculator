      <h2>Understanding BMI</h2>
      <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
      <p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. It is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height.</p>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Why BMI is Important?</h3>
    <p>BMI is a useful indicator of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. Being overweight or underweight can lead to health issues, so maintaining a healthy BMI can help prevent health problems.</p>

    <h3>Limitations of BMI:</h3>
    <p>While BMI is a useful measurement for most people, it does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, and differences related to race and sex. Thus, it may not be accurate for everyone.</p>
